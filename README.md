Description
Developed regression model for predicting movie revenue and ratings from 5000 movie data.
Performed data analysis, visualization, feature extraction, cleaning (missing value, anomaly), preprocessing (rescaling, normalization, feature transformation (one hot encoding)) and trained with cross-validation.
With 35 numerical and categorical features attained MSE of 11.5 using xgboost with hyperparameter tuning.
